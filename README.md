# blogpress, the world's greatest blog

A basic, SQL-backed Express web server CRUD app for posting, well, posts.

For the future:
 - comments
 - users
 - style
 - better homepage, with first couple of lines of each post

Yeah, its pretty basic.


But here's a spec:

 - User gets a list of existing blog titles, each of which is clickable.
 - User can read each post, one at a time by clicking title.
 - From view page, user can choose to edit post, or delete post.
 - From home page, user can add a new post.
